# Week 5: LINEAR DATA STRUCTURES

### **STACK**

Stack is a linear data structure that follows a LIFO rule of retrieval. This can be implemented by pointers or using an array. Pointers will add more overhead because of the objects and pointer we will have to make. We will go over both ways to make a stack.

### **QUEUE**

Queue is a linear data structure as well but follows a FIFO rule of retrieval. We will implement them with pointers and arrays as well. Queues are used in everyday life like waiting in line for a movie or playing your spotify playlist in a queue.

### **LINKED LIST**

Linked List we covered in Week 2 and are done by using pointers. They can be indexed unlike Queue and Stack and also have a tail and head unlike Queue and Stack.

### **DOUBLY LINKED LIST**

Doubly Linked List are different because every node has two pointers to the next and previous element. This way nodes can accessed bidirectional.

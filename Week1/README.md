# Week 1 : Data Structures & Algorithms

Hello guys! Week 1 of DSA will be covering an actual introduction to Data Structures and what they are. Data Structures usually will be broken down into two categories **Linear Data Structures** and **Non-Linear Data Structures** also known as **Hierarchical**.

> ## Linear Data Structures

A linear data structure have data elements arranged in sequential manner and each member is connected to it's previous and next element. Data structures like these are what you guys have proabably heard of and worked with - **List**, **Queue**, **Stack**, **Array**.

> ## Non-Linear

Data Structures that are Non-Linear well are not linear... so it covers a wide amount of data structures however we can touch on a very important category in the Non-Linear realm of data structures.

> ### Hierarchical Data Structures

Hierarchical Structures are multi level data structures. Lets understand hierarchy, which is where there are ranks and the highest rank would be a king or queen and the people under the king are his subordinates.

Well in these types of data structures there are ranks or levels where you will hear **parents** and **children**. Parents would be above the children and children could also have children thus making them parents.

You guys will see **Binary Trees** , **Heaps**, and many more different type of trees.

# OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

Today we will touch on OOP and see how it is done on C++! The whole point of C++ was to add OOP design to C so C++ has many rich features to handle OOP. We will be displaying how to do **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**. We will be ofcourse using classes to do so and another version of making objects called **structs**. Lets define some things to avoid confusion.

> ### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the structure of bundling properties and functions all within a single Object. To access these properties and functions you will have to instantiate the object that encapsulates those desired poperties and functions. Its a neat way to keep your code stored within an object since those properties and functions may only apply to the Object. Say we have a Shape class and we want to get the area. Well it only makes sense that a getArea() function lives within the Shape class.

> ### Inheritance

Inheritance is the idea of Objects being able to have children or make relationships with other Objects. If we go back to the Shape class as an example. The Shape class can have a child class called the Square Class. So this way the Square Class inherits all of the functions and properties that the Shape Class has!

> ### Polymorphism

Polymorphism only comes after Inheritance is applied. Say for instance we have many classes that inherit from the Shape Class. Lets say Square, Rectangle, Circle class for instance. Well these children classes will have to change the getArea() function to match their specific formulas. Polymorphism is the act of over-riding a function that has been inherited and styling it to the needs of child class.

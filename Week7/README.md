# Week 7

## Reviewing Stacks

Stacks are Linear Data Structures taht follow a LIFO rule of removal. We have made a Stack in Week5 and made the implementation in a seperate header file for you guys to use in your projects. Today we will be using the stack in order to conver Infix Expressions to Postfix Expressions.

## What is Infix vs Postfix?

To dive into this lets clear some terminology. We all have heard of operators from coding and doing math with any of our variables, this is like the plus sign (+), subtract sign (-). Now we also know what an operand is, an operand is like a number for example eg.) 7. An operand is anything that can be mathematically operated on. Now thats clear we can understand what Infix is and Postfix.

**Infix expression** is an expression in which the operator is in the middle of operands, like operand operator operand.

- INFIX
  - 1+2

**Postfix expression** is an expression in which the operator is after operands, like operand operator.

- POSTFIX
  - 12+

## How to create the Infix to Postfix Convertion?

Okay we are going to try to make this program using our stack headerfile and we will see what we need in order to.

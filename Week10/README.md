# Week 10 Sorts

### Bubble Sort O(n^2)

### Selection Sort O(n^2)

### Insertion Sort O(n^2)

### Quick Sort

### Recap (HASH MAPS)

- What is the aim for time complexity in **retrieval** and **insertion**. 
> Answer : O(1)

- What are the two ways to handle collisions?
> Seperate Chaining (Linked Lists)
> Open Addressing (Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, Closed/Bucket Hashing)

- Time Complexities

O(1) - Constant
O(n) - Linear - For Loop
O(n^2) - Quadratic - Two Nested For Loops
O(log(n)) - Logarithmic - Recursion + Splitting the Search Space
